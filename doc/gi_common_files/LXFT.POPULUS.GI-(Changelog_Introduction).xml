  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>The changelog describes the changes done in different versions of
  Luxoft Populus Safety Critical.</para>
  <para>Each new major or minor release is based on an earlier release. For
  example, release 4.4.0 is based on release 4.3.0. All features and defect
  fixes that were part of 4.3.0 are also part of 4.4.0. However, if later on a
  defect is fixed in e.g. 4.3.1, it is not automatically part of 4.4.0 since
  4.3.1 in that case would have been released after 4.4.0. The related defect
  has been also fixed in 4.4.x, if it is repeated in the changelog of e.g.
  version 4.4.1.</para>
